⚙️ Predictive Maintenance for Manufacturing Equipment

📌 Overview

This project predicts equipment failures in manufacturing using machine learning models trained on sensor data.
It uses XGBoost for classification, along with preprocessing (scaling & label encoding).
A Streamlit app is included to provide real-time predictions and feature insights.

🚀 Features

Predicts equipment failure modes from sensor inputs

Preprocessing pipeline with scaler & label encoder

Interactive Streamlit web app

Saved ML model (xgboost_failure_mode.pkl) for quick loading

Supports real-time failure predictions

🎯 Future Improvements

Add SHAP explainability for feature impact

Deploy on cloud (Heroku/Streamlit Cloud)

Extend to multi-equipment predictive analytics
